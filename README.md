# Robustness of RL-based Communication Networks to Channel Noise and Graph Constrained Adversarial Attacks

Modification and expansion of the work of Sukhbaatar et. al (see: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736>). 

Initial code pulled from our other repo, <http://github.com/marcusvgomez/bfua> . Branches became prohibitively unmanageable so we recloned and started over.  Check out CommNet/ for majority of codebase.
